Container core techs:

- Namespaces
A global resource within a namespace appears to be an isolated instance of the global resource

- Cgroups
Processes organized in hierarchical groups whose usage of system resources can be limited and monitored
Examples -> limit cpu cycles, memory usage, disk read throttling

- Union Mount Filesystem (Docker OverlayFS):
Shows files and directories of separate file systems (branches)
as a single coherent filesystem, identical paths are merged.
Images consist of lower and upper layers.
Lower layers can be shared and cached to save space on container images
