There are many (DockerHub, GitHub, AWS, GCP, Azure), they have different authentication
Public -> Can download without auth
Private -> Needs auth for both push & pull

To push a built repo:
Authenticate to the repo
    docker login
Tag the image corresponding to the repo (dockerhub is default)
    docker tag imagename username/imagename:anc-123
    docker push username/imagename:abc-123

    docker tag imagename ghcr.io/username/imagename:anc-123
    docker push ghcr.io/username/imagename:abc-123

Images can have multiple tags pointing to the same image
Apart from temporary development tags, they should be treated as immutable
Automated builds should use combinations of
    - timestamp
    - build ID from ci
    - Commit hash used to build image
    - SemVer release version
    - If not DockerHub, registry host should prefix the image name
