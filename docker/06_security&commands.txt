## Image Security

*“What vulnerabilities exist in your image that an attacker could exploit?”*

- Keep attack surface area as small as possible:
  - Use minimal base images (multi-stage builds are a key enabler)
  - Don’t install things you don’t need (don’t install dev deps)
- Scan images!
- Use users with minimal permissions
- Keep sensitive info out of images
- Sign and verify images
- Use fixed image tags, either:
  - Pin major.minor (allows patch fixes to be integrated)
  - Pin specific image hash

## Runtime Security

*If an attacker successfully compromises a container, what can they do? How difficult will it be to move laterally?*

### Docker daemon (dockerd)
  - Start with --userns-remap option(https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/)

### Individual containers:
- Use read only filesystem if writes are not needed
- --cap-drop=all, then --cap-add anything you need
- Limit cpu and memory --cpus=“0.5” --memory 1024m
- Use --security-opt
  - seccomp profiles (https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/)
  - apparmor profiles (https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/)


Interacting with docker objects:
1) Use the documentation here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/
2) Use the `--help` flag (e.g. `docker build --help`) to get more info about each command.
docker image --help
docker container --help
docker volume --help
docker network --help
