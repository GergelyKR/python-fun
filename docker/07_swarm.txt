Docker Swarm -> better for deployment due to compose's limitations
 - Downtimes, inconvenient rollback
 - No way to handle credentials (encrypted secrets)
 - Can only be used on a single host (we want HA)

Docker swarm does provide those things and setting up a single node cluster can be done with one command docker swarm init. Making just a few modifications to the docker compose file (adding deploy configurations, passing sensitive info as secrets and reading those data as files within the applications) it is ready to deploy.

Create a virtual machine with your favorite cloud provider. Make sure to set up the firewall to listen on ports 80, 443, and 22.
Use the script at https://get.docker.com/ to install docker engine. If managing docker as a non-root user, you may need to follow these steps: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/ after installing.
Set the DOCKER_HOST environment variable in the Makefile to USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS of your virtual machine (this will allow your local docker client to use the remote docker daemon!)
Build and push the container images to a registry
Populate the secrets by running make create-secrets
Deploy the application by running make swarm-deploy-stack (uses the docker stack deploy command under the hood)
Set up a DNS A record to route traffic to your VM (or access using the IP address)
