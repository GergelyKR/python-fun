GitHub Event -> Triggers a workflow (e.g. pushing to a branch, creating a pull request)

Workflow (pipelines) -> Consists of one or more jobs (with one or more steps ordered in a specific manner)

Between steps -> same computing env
Across jobs -> different computing env (need to pass data, share env variables or state, etc.)

Steps can be
 - inline/local ("run")
 - actions ("uses")
---
 - A non-default shell can also be specified

Workflows form a Directe Acyclic Graph (DAG)
 - "needs" (dependencies) specify the structure

Almost any GH event can trigger a workflow:
 - Manual (workflow_dispatch)
 - Push to branch
 - Create/update Pull request
 - Cron Schedule
 - ...

Triggers to events can be filtered based on specific characteristics:
 - Branch names
 - Paths/files changes

- - -
Environment variables
 - They can be scoped
    - Workflow
    - Job
    - Step

 - Variables can be passed using:
   - Step & job inputs/outputs
   - Environment variables

 - Variables and secrets can be stored in
   - GitHub Organization (Enterprise only)
   - Repository
   - Environment (e.g. staging/production)

 - Contexts -> can be accessed at runtime with ${{ ... }}
   - needs -> outputs & results from dependent jobs
   - steps -> prior steps' outputs, outcome/conclusion
   - secrets -> secret values incl. GITHUB_TOKEN
   - vars -> repo/org/environment-level config variables (great for cross-workflow settings)
   - - - -
   - github -> run & event metadata (repo, ref, sha, event_name, etc.)
   - env -> variables set at workflow/job/step scope (override rules: step > job > workflow)
   - matrix -> current matrix values (e.g. os, node)
   - strategy -> matrix strategy info (job-index, job-total, fail-fast, max-parallel)
   - job -> current job status; container/service info
   - runner -> runner OS/arch/temp/tool_cache
   - inputs -> parameters to reusable/workflow_dispach workflows
