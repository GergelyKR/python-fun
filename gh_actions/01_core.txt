GitHub Event -> Triggers a workflow (e.g. pushing to a branch, creating a pull request)

Workflow (pipelines) -> Consists of one or more jobs (with one or more steps ordered in a specific manner)

Between steps -> same computing env
Across jobs -> different computing env (need to pass data, share env variables or state, etc.)

Steps can be
 - inline/local ("run")
 - actions ("uses")
---
 - A non-default shell can also be specified

Workflows form a Directe Acyclic Graph (DAG)
 - "needs" (dependencies) specify the structure

Almost any GH event can trigger a workflow:
 - Manual (workflow_dispatch)
 - Push to branch
 - Create/update Pull request
 - Cron Schedule
 - ...

Triggers to events can be filtered based on specific characteristics:
 - Branch names
 - Paths/files changes
