Help command: kubectl explain namespaces

Namespaces -> Group resources within a cluster
    Initial namespaces:
        - default
        - kube-system
        - kube-node-lease
        - kube-public
    By default, they do not provide network/security boundary
    Useful to put an app or a group of interacting apps in their own namespaces
    Best practice to use them for group things logically

Pods -> Smallest deployable unit where the containers run
    - Can contain multiple containers
    - Networking and storage is shared within a Pods
    - Init container: Runs before startup of the other containers
    - Sidecar container: Runs alongside containers (example: network proxy)
    - Other configs:
        - Ports
        - Health probes
        - Resource requests/limits
        - Security context
        - Env. variables
        - Volumes
        - DNS policies

ReplicaSet -> Takes a pod definition and wraps it in another layer
    - Labels are the link between ReplicaSets and Pods

Deployment -> Adds the concept of "rollouts" and "rollbacks"
    - Used for long-running stateless applications
    - Specify pod specs, how many replicas needed, smoothly move between versions, configs
    - Reapplying a modified yaml template will smoothly replace one pod at a time

Service -> Internal load balancer across replicas
    - Uses pod labels to determine which pods to serve
    - Types:
        - ClusterIP: Internal to cluster
        - NodePort: Listens on each node in cluster
        - LoadBalancer: Provisions external load balancer

Job -> Adds the concept of tracking "completions"
    - Only runs at creation
    - Used for execution of workloads that run to completion
    - It will retry failed attempts (restartPolicy, backoffLimit)
    - More params:
        - parallelism
        - completions
        - activeDeadlineSeconds

CronJob -> Adds the concept of a "schedule"
    - Used for periodic execution of workloads that run to completion
    - Uses cronjob format to spawn jobs but also can be triggered manually (k create job --from)
