Help command: kubectl explain namespaces

Namespaces -> Group resources within a cluster
    Initial namespaces:
        - default
        - kube-system
        - kube-node-lease
        - kube-public
    By default, they do not provide network/security boundary
    Useful to put an app or a group of interacting apps in their own namespaces
    Best practice to use them for group things logically

Pods -> Smallest deployable unit where the containers run
    - Can contain multiple containers
    - Networking and storage is shared within a Pods
    - Init container: Runs before startup of the other containers
    - Sidecar container: Runs alongside containers (example: network proxy)
    - Other configs:
        - Ports
        - Health probes
        - Resource requests/limits
        - Security context
        - Env. variables
        - Volumes
        - DNS policies

ReplicaSet -> Takes a pod definition and wraps it in another layer
    - Labels are the link between ReplicaSets and Pods
