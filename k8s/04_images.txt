Dockerfile -> Contains the commands a user could call on the CLI to assemble an image

Usual recipe:
 - Select OS
 - Install language runtime
 - Install app dependencies
 - Set up execution Environment
 - Run application

Registry -> Store and access built images
 - The cluster or CI server can then pull these images directly
 - During build the target server architecture can be emulated (docker buildx)
