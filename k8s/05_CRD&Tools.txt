K8s is not just a container orchestrator
    - Provides API for declaring, observing and acting on a set of resources
    - Custom Resource Definitions allow apps to extend the default resource set
    - Custom controllers observe and act upon CustomResourceDefinition
    - Use Cases:
        - Embed custom logic into "Operators" (CloudNative PG)
        - Manage TLS certificates (Cert-Manager)
        - Deploy infrastructure with automatic reconciliation (Crossplane)
        - Anything needed

Tooling
    - kubebuilder to build controllers 
    - Operator SDK
    - Metacontroller
    - Build your own with any k8s client

- - -

- CloudNative PG -> PostGreSQL resources to be used in cloud k8s
- Trivy -> Container auditing & vulnerability scanning
- Cert Manager -> Provision and management of TLS certs
- External Secrets Operator -> Store source of truth for secrets outside the cluster
- SaaS Monitoring & Observability (Datadog, Grafana Cloud, etc...)
- Self-hosted Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, etc...)
- GitOps tools -> Automatically keep cluster state synced with configurations in Git
- Service Meshes
- Open Policy Agent -> Compliance, rules
- Crossplane -> IaaS tool
- Knative -> Serverless platform
- Kubevirt -> Deploy and manage VMs
- Velero -> Backup & Restore tool

Tools to help rebuild/reload services when changes are made:

- Tilt (https://tilt.dev/)
- Skaffold (https://skaffold.dev/)
- Telepresence (https://www.telepresence.io/)
- mirrord (https://mirrord.dev/)

Tilt allows for configurating your application such that each service will automatically rebuild/reload within the cluster when changes are made.

Tools for secrets management:

Often one of the most painful parts of any application deployment. The rest of the configuration lives within version control (e.g. Git), but we cannot safely store these credentials there.
Methods to approach this problem:

1. Manually create/update secrets out of band -> The first approach people take is to manually create any secrets. This requires no setup, but quickly becomes unmanageable and will eventually lead to pain.
2. External Secrets Operator (https://external-secrets.io/latest/) -> ESO provides a way to mirror secrets for an external provider (such as Google Cloud Secret Manager OR 1Pass) as Kubernetes secrets. This allows you to keep the sensitive information in a tool built for such a purpose and reference these with non-sensitive configurations which can live alongside your other configuration. This is the approach which is shown here!
3. Sealed Secrets (https://sealed-secrets.netlify.app/) and `SOPs` (https://github.com/getsops/sops) -> These projects enable you to encrypt secrets such that you can safely store the encrypted version in version control and decrypt them within the cluster for use by your applications.
4. Skip k8s secrets entirely -> Some people prefer to avoid Kubernetes secrets whereever possible and load them directly from an external system such as Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Doppler.
