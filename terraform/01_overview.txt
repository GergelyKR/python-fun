Terraform
 - Tool for building, changing, versioning infrastructure (IaC)
 - Enables application software best practices to infrastructure
 - Compatible with many clouds and services

Categories of IaC tools:
 - Ad hoc scripts
 - Config management tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef)
 - Server Templating tools
 - Orchestration tools (K8s)
 - Provisioning tools (meaning, provisioning cloud resources)

Declarative -> Define the end state, the tool calls the API
Imperative -> Define what you want to happen, in which order

Cloud Specific -> CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager
Cloud Agnostic -> Terraform, Pulumi

Common patterns:
 - Terraform for provisioning VMs (or K8s cluster)
 - Ansible for installing dependencies on the VMs
 - Packer to prepackage dependencies into VM images for Terraform
 - K8s to define how the application is deployed and managed on provisioned cloud resources

Architecture:
