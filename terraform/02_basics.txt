Basic usage sequence

 - terraform init -> Initializes project
    - Downloads defined provider(s) to working dir
    - Creates lockfile for dependencies
    - Downloads configs associated with used modules
    - Creates state file (JSON file containing info about every resource and data object deployed via TF)
        - Can contain sensitive info (e.g. DB password)
        - Can also be stored remotely
            - Sensitive data encrypted
            - Collaboration possible
            - Automation possible

 - terraform plan -> Checks the config against the currently deployed state and prepares the set of commands to achieve the target
    - Compares Config file (desired state) to State file (actual state)
    - Collects the API commands to achieve desired state

 - terraform apply -> Takes the set of commands and applies them

 - terraform destroy -> Take down the existing infrastructure
    - Cleans up the entire project
