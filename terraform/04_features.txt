Meta-Arguments

depends_on
    - Terraform automatically generates dependency graph based on references
    - If two resources depend on each other (but not each others data), depends_on specifies that dependency to enforce ordering

count
    - Allows for creation of multiple resources/modules from a single block
    - Useful when the multiple necessary resources are nearly identical

for_each
    - Allows for creation of multiple resources/modules from a single block
    - Allows more control to customize each resource than count

lifecycle
    - A set of meta arguments to control Terraform behavior for specific resources
    - create_before_destroy can help with zero downtime deployments
    - ignore_changes prevents Terraform from trying to revert metadata being set elsewhere
    - prevent_destroy causes Terraform to reject any plan which would destroy this resource
