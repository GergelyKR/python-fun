Managing multiple environments through one config
    1. Workspaces: Multiple named sections within a single backend
        - Easy to get started
        - Convenient terraform.workspace expression
        - Minimizes code duplication
        but
        - Prone to human error
        - State stored within same backend
        - Codebase doesn't unambiguously show deployment configurations
    2. File Structure: Directory layout provides separation, modules provide reuse
        - Isolation of backends for improved security and less chance of human error
        - Codebase fully represents deployed State
        but
        - Multiple terraform applies required to provision environments
        - More code duplication, but modules can improve on that

For larger deployments it's useful to
    - Separate at logical component groups (e.g. compute, network), isolate frequently changing components
    - Reference resources across configurations with "terrraform_remote_state"

There are also utilities like Terragrunt for simplicity and automation
    - Keeps TF code DRY
    - Executes commands across multiple TF configs
    - Works with multiple cloud accounts
