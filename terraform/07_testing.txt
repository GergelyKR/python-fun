Why is it needed?

Code Rot -> Code degradation over time
    - Out of band changes (someone modifies infra via UI)
    - Unpinned versions (not using a specified version of provider)
    - Deprecated dependencies (e.g. external modules, cloud resource types)
    - Unapplied changes

Static checks
    - Built in
        - terraform fmt (helps formatting)
        - terraform validate (checks required input variables,  types, etc.)
        - terraform plan (compares config to current state)
        - custom validation rules (e.g. expected length of a variable)

    - External
        - tflint
        - checkov, tfsec, terrascan, terraform-compliance, snyk (security scanning)
        - Terraform Sentinel (enterprise only)

Manual testing -> commands can be automated with bash script
(Example, apply the config, include a sleep timer and then curl against the new URL)

Automated testing -> Define more complex testing logic with programming languages (example Go & Terratest)
