Development considerations - - -

General workflow
    - Write/update Code
    - Run changes locally (for development environment)
    - Create pull request
    - Run tests via CI
    - Deploy to staging via CD (on merge to main)
    - Deploy to production via CD (on release)

Using multi-account / project setup
    - Simplify IAM policies for enforcing controls for different environments (and remote TF backends)
    - Isolate environments for protection and to minimize blast radius
    - Reduce resource naming conflicts
    - Some extra complexity to TF config but its warranted and there's tooling for assistance

Additional tools
    - Terragrunt
        - Minimizes code repetition
        - Enables multi-account separation (improved isolation / security)
    - Cloud Nuke
        - Easy cleanup of cloud resources
    - Makefiles
        - Prevent human error

CI/CD tools
    - GitHub Actions
    - CircleCI
    - GitLab
    - Atlantis

Things to look out for:
    - Name changes when refactoring (might destroy resources that we intented to keep)
    - Sensitive data in TF state files (should be kept securely and encrypted)
    - Cloud timeouts (some resources take longer to create, TF application might time out)
    - Forgetting to destroy test-infra (incurs unwanted bills)
    - Uni-directional version upgrades (TF state file won't accept applications from older version)
    - Multiple ways to accomplish same configuration
    - Some params are immutable (resource has to be recreated to change)
    - Out of band changes (Changes made via Cloud UI will be destroyed by next TF apply)
